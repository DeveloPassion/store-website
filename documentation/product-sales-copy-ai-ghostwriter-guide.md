## Marketing Copy - PAS Framework

### Problem
**The Challenge**: AI gives you generic slop, not YOUR voice.

**Pain Points**:
- 😤 "This doesn't sound like me at all"
- 😤 Generic text that could apply to anyone
- 😤 Spend MORE time editing than writing from scratch
- 😤 Throwing random prompts, hoping for magic
- 😤 Every piece needs heavy editing
- 😤 Frustrated with AI - "it doesn't work"

**Why It's Not Working**:
- Using AI like everyone else
- Generic prompts hoping for unique content
- Starting over with new prompts every time
- Settling for "good enough" that needs fixing
- You haven't TAUGHT AI to write like YOU
