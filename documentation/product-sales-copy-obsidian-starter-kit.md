## Marketing Copy - PAS Framework

### Problem
**The Challenge**: Obsidian is powerful but overwhelming. Most people spend weeks or months figuring out how to organize their notes, what plugins to use, and how to build productive workflows.

**Pain Points**:
- ❌ Spend weeks figuring out folder structure
- ❌ Trial-and-error with dozens of plugins
- ❌ Manually build templates from scratch

### Agitate
**Time Cost**: 100+ hours of setup + 10 hours/month ongoing maintenance

**The Frustration**:
- Scattered resources across hundreds of articles and YouTube videos
- No clear "right way" to organize - just endless opinions
- Plugin overwhelm - 1,000+ available, which ones actually matter?
- Templates that don't auto-file or maintain consistency
- Starting from scratch feels like reinventing the wheel

### Solution
**OSK Solution**: A complete, battle-tested system that gives you sophisticated personal knowledge management on day one.

**Transformation**:
- ✅ Battle-tested system, ready in 30 minutes
- ✅ Carefully curated plugins, pre-configured
