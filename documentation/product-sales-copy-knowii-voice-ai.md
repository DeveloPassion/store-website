## Marketing Copy - PAS Framework

### Problem

**The Bottleneck**: Your keyboard is the bottleneck between your thoughts and getting things done.

**The Reality**:

- Average typing speed: 40 words per minute
- Average speaking speed: 150 words per minute
- **You speak 3.75x faster than you type**

**Daily Frustrations**:

- Your fingers can't keep up with your brain
- You hunt for keys while your thoughts race ahead
- Autocorrect changes words you didn't want changed
- You stop to fix typos and lose your train of thought
- Five minutes pass, you've written three sentences
- By noon you've typed 5,000 words and your hands hurt
- By 3pm you're abbreviating because you're tired of typing

### Agitate

**The Cost of Typing**:

**Time Lost**:

- Writing for 2 hours/day typing: 4,800 words
- Writing for 2 hours/day speaking: 18,000 words
- **Difference**: 13,200 more words OR get back 88 minutes per day
- **7.3 hours per week wasted**
- **380 hours per year lost** to keyboard bottleneck

**The Compounding Frustration**:

- Every email takes 10 minutes to type carefully
- Blog posts: staring at blank page because gap between thought and text is exhausting
- Code documentation: you avoid it because it takes forever
- Commit messages: rushed and vague
- PR descriptions: copy-pasted templates
- AI prompts: you're the bottleneck, not AI

**Physical Cost**:

- Tired hands
- Sore neck from looking down at keyboard
- End day drained from typing

3. **Release the key** - AI transcribes (on your computer, offline) and pastes exactly where cursor is

**The Transformation**:

- Responses faster and more thorough
- Clear inbox in half the time
- Leave work with energy (not drained from typing)
- First drafts spoken like explaining to a friend
