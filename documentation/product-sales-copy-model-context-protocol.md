## Marketing Copy - PAS Framework

### Problem

**The Challenge**: AI is powerful but blind—it can't access your data, files, or tools without you manually copying everything.

**Pain Points**:

- 😰 Copy-paste files and data into AI conversations
- 😰 AI can't read your notes, databases, or work files
- 😰 Have to manually fetch information AI needs
- 😰 No way to let AI interact with your tools
- 😰 Limited to what fits in a single conversation
- 😰 Wasting time being AI's "hands" instead of thinking

> "Why can't AI just... access what it needs?"

### Agitate

**What LLMs Miss Most**: Integrations.

Without integrations, AI is trapped:

- ❌ **Can't read your Obsidian notes** - You copy-paste manually
- ❌ **Can't access your databases** - You run queries and share results
- ❌ **Can't search the web** - You search and paste findings
- ❌ **Can't control your browser** - You do everything manually
- ❌ **Can't use your tools** - You're the middleman for everything
- ❌ **Can't scale** - Only works with what fits in chat

**The Reality**:
You're spending hours being AI's assistant, when AI should be YOUR assistant. There's a better way.

### Solution

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard that connects AI to your data sources and tools, letting AI access what it needs automatically.

**What Changes**:
With MCP:

- ✅ **AI reads your notes** - Direct access to Obsidian, Notion, etc.
- ✅ **AI searches the web** - Brave Search, Google, etc.
- ✅ **AI controls your browser** - Navigate, interact, extract data
- ✅ **AI queries databases** - SQLite, Postgres, etc.
- ✅ **AI uses tools** - Hundreds of integrations available
- ✅ **You think strategically** - AI handles the execution

**The Result**: Transform AI from limited chatbot to powerful agent that can actually DO things with your data and tools.

## Description

Deep dive masterclass into the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the open standard introduced by Anthropic that makes Large Language Models dramatically more powerful by connecting them to data sources and tools.

Learn what MCP is, why it matters, how it works, where to find MCP servers, how to install and configure them, and multiple ways to leverage them—including with your Obsidian knowledge base.

Includes 5 live demos showing real MCP capabilities in action.
